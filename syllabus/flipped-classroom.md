# Flipped Class Room

This class has been designed to reduce the amount of time spent lecturing in class and to increase the amount of time spent doing hands-on exercises in class. This model requires that you prepare for class by doing the pre-class preparation specified for each class meeting. Class time will be spent doing the following:

- Discussing concepts that should have been learned during pre-class preparation
- Discussing the class project
- Doing hands-on programming exercises

Quizzes will be used to hold students accountable for their pre-class preparation and to help with midterm/final exam preparation. There are open-book, online quizzes for almost all course topics.

In-class programming exercises will be used to provide concrete, hands-on experience that will help students understand and remember the concepts being learned.

## Laptop

A laptop computer will be needed to take quizzes and complete programming exercises, so be sure to bring your laptop to class every day. If you do not have a laptop of your own, you may rent one from the [BYU Office of Information Technology (OIT)](https://support.byu.edu/it?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=40d008721baaa2108082ebd1b24bcb77). You will need to write and execute TypeScript programs using [Node.js]((https://nodejs.org/en/download)) on your laptop. Therefore, Node.js as well as your IDE of choice (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) must be installed on your laptop.

## Pre-class preparation

For each class period there are reading and/or video assignments that you need to complete before class. Links to these pre-class assignments are found on the course calendar. If you do not complete these assignments before class, you will struggle on the programming exercises done in class. You do not need to purchase any textbooks for the class. All of the readings and videos are available online from one of the following sources:

- O'Reilly
- LinkedIn Learning
- PDF files on Canvas

As a BYU student, you have free access to O'Reilly and LinkedIn Learning. The following sections explain how to access each of these online learning platforms.
