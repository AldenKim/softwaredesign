## For help during class hours:

There are TAs available on Slack during class hours, while their attention is primarily on the students in class. Pass offs are not guaranteed by in class TA's. If you need help during the other section's class time use the #exercies & #milestone channels on our slack. ( Join SlackLinks to an external site. )

## For help in person:

Message a TA on slack first, then if they indicate that they are available, go to the TA Lab in TMCB 1160.
