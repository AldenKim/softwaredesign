## Flipped classroom

Read ahead! A typical class will go as follows:

- Open prayer and Q&A (5 minutes)
- Discussion of topic, good chance to ask any questions you have (20 mins)
- Exercise
- Introduce exercise (5 mins)
- Student's work on exercise in individually or in groups (25 mins)
- Instructor and TAs will answer questions
- Discuss (partial) solution to the exercise (remaining time)

Notes

- Why quizzes?
    - Gentle encouragement to do the reading (hopefully) before class
    - Help students prepare for midterm and final exams
- Why give partial solutions?
    - It is a mechanism for reinforcing the concepts being discussed 
    - If you do your reading and come to class you will almost certainly get full credit for the exercises.
